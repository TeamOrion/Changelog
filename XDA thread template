[SIZE="4"]OrionOS is a project based on slim. The name Orion was chosen as a representation of the beauty and vastness of the world around us (Too much Philosophy, eh? :P ). We started this project for Falcon (Moto G), to make a stable Rom, which would include Bitsyko layers and important customization. The Rom is built with Uber toolchain which delivers awesome smoothness and includes a custom kernel built from ground-up to ensure good performance [WIP].  Needless to say, this project is a product of our hobbies and the love we bore for Android. [/SIZE]
